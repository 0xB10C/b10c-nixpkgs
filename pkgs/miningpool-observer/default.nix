      The miningpool-observer project compares block templates produced by a
      Bitcoin Core node to blocks produced by mining pools to provide insights
      about:
      - Shared, missing, and extra transactions per template and block pair
      - Transactions missing from multiple blocks they should have been included in
      - Template and block transactions conflicting with each other
      - Blocks not including transactions to or from OFAC sanctioned addresses
